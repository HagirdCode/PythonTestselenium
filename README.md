**Selenium Web Automation with Python: Flipkart Project**
This project is an exploration of web automation using Selenium and Python. The aim of the project was to gain hands-on experience with Selenium WebDriver by automating interactions with a well-known eCommerce website, Flipkart.com.

#Project Overview
The primary objective of this project was to automate web browsing tasks on Flipkart to understand the usage of Selenium for web scraping, testing, and general automation. The project involved writing Python scripts that simulate user behavior, such as searching for products, filtering search results, and extracting product details.

#Key Features:
Automated Searching: Automated the process of searching for products based on predefined keywords.
Product Filtering: Created scripts that interact with product filters like price range, brand, and ratings.
Data Extraction: Extracted relevant product data, including name, price, ratings, and link.
Browser Automation: Used Selenium WebDriver to simulate user interactions, such as clicking on elements, scrolling, and navigating between pages.

#Tools and Technologies Used:
Python: Programming language used for scripting.
Selenium WebDriver: Used for automating web interactions.
ChromeDriver: Browser driver for Chrome.
BeautifulSoup (optional, if applicable): Used for parsing the extracted HTML content.

#Project Structure:
flipkart_automation.py: Main script for automating searches, applying filters, and extracting data from Flipkart.
requirements.txt: Contains the dependencies required to run the project.
README.md: This file, which explains the project.

#Learning Outcomes:
Gained practical knowledge in using Selenium with Python for web automation.
Improved understanding of web scraping and how to handle dynamic content.
Learned how to interact with HTML elements (like buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns) programmatically.

#Installation:
Clone this repository.
Install required Python packages by running:
bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the appropriate version of ChromeDriver installed to match your browser version.
Usage:
Run the flipkart_automation.py script to start the automation process:

bash
Copy
python flipkart_automation.py
